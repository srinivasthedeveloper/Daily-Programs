You have a garden of C tomato crops, and you want to cook an amazing soup of N tomatoes in D days. Each tomato crop is represented by a digit from 0 to 9, which is how many days you have to wait until harvest it.

Example: If your garden is 2224, you'll harvest 3 tomatoes in 2 days, and 1 tomato in 4 days.

Goal: In D days, will you be able to cook a beautiful soup containing at least N tomatoes from your garden?
Input
Line 1: Tomato crops C, Needed tomatoes for the soup N, Delay until soup-day D
Line 2: Garden, C digits from 0 to 9 representing how many days you have to wait to harvest each crop
Output
"YOU_CAN_MAKE_A_SOUP_IN_D_DAYS" if you have enough tomatoes after D days to make a soup, or "YOU_CANNOT_MAKE_A_SOUP_IN_D_DAYS".
