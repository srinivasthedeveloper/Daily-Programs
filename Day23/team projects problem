Project Teams

N employees are working in a company. Each employee has a rating (positive/negative). A positive rating means the employee is performing good and a negative rating means the employee is performing poor. The company has decided to form teams based on the following conditions.
- Each team contains at most 5 employees.
- Each team can have a maximum of 3 employees with negative rating.
The program must accept N integers representing the ratings of the N employees as the input. The program must print the minimum number of teams T (that can be formed based on the above conditions) as the output.
Note: All ratings are non-zero.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
-10 <= Each integer value <= 10

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains T.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:   
6
5 -1 -6 -2 -6 7

Output:
2

Explanation:
There are 2 employees with positive ratings and 4 employees with negative ratings. One of the possible ways is given below.
The first team can be formed with 5 employees (5 -1 -2 -6 7).
The second team can be formed with 1 employee (-6).
Hence the output is 2.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
9
2 -5 -7 -2 -10 -3 -4 -6 -3

Output:
3
