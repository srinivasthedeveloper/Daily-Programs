Alice and Bob have a secret code, where each letter is swapped symmetrically (A and Z, B and Y, etc; similarly for lower case). Other characters will not be changed.
Help Bob decrypt Alice's messages.

** PLUS Bob would like to know if the message is secure or not. A message is considered as secure if at least 50% of the characters in the message (excluding newlines) are modified. **

Example:
Input:

Hi Bob, how are you? it's looking nice for our evening out,
can't wait! xoxo -Alice. ❤❤❤


Output:

Sr Yly, sld ziv blf? rg'h ollprmt mrxv uli lfi vevmrmt lfg,
xzm'g dzrg! clcl -Zorxv. ❤❤❤
Secure
