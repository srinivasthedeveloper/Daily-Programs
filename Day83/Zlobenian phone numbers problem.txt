Zlobenian phone numbers contain 12 digits, the first one always being 0. The normalized format represents a number as 4 groups of 3 digits, separated by spaces, e.g. 034 278 556 023.
However, people tend to write the numbers with varied spacing, using groups of digits of varying sizes, possibly with no spacing at all.
Furthermore when the international country code of Zlobenia, +879, is indicated, the leading zero may be omitted or shown between parentheses, e.g. + 879 34 278 556 023 or + 879 (0)34 278 556 023.

Your program must read a single Zlobenian phone number in arbitrary format and output its normalized representation.

Constraints
The number is always valid (no missing digits, no extra characters, no typos, etc). Only the formatting differs from the normalized representation.
