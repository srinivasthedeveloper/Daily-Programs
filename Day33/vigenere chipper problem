You are working in a Government Security Department. Your task is to encrypt all packets sent over a network. All information have to be encrypted using the Vigenere's encryption formula and a ciphertext is what has to be sent. You are given a key and have to encrypt the message.

N.B: The key has to be repeated to match the length of the string or message. If the key is longer than the message, only the part of the key matching the size of the message will be used.

Example1:
Input:
Message = i am codingame
key = code
Output: k op gqrlriopi

key = code , with c=2, o=14, d=3 and e=4

Note: i+c=i+2=k

The ciphertext text is made up of the letters corresponding to those sums:
which gives: k op gqrlriopi
Input
Line 1: A string or message to be encrypted.
Line 2: A word to be used as the key.
Output
Output the encrypted string or message(ciphertext)
Constraints
Only Encode letters
The key contains only lowercase letters
White spaces are ignored, the key character will be assigned to the next following character in the message and numbers and handled like white spaces
Example
Input

i am a programmer
ab

Output

i bm b psohrbmnes
