Palindromic Time

The program must accept a time T in 24-hour format (HH:MM) as the input. The program must print the next palindromic time of T in 24-hour format (HH:MM) as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Boundary Condition(s):
0 <= HH <= 23
0 <= MM <= 59

Inpur Format:
The first line contains the time T in 24-hour format (HH:MM).

Output Format:
The first line contains the next palindromic time of T in 24-hour format (HH:MM).

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12:10

Output:
12:21

Explanation:
Here the time T = 12:10, so the next palindromic time is 12:21.
The reverse of 12:21 is equal to the same time itself.
So 12:21 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
05:55

Output:
10:01
