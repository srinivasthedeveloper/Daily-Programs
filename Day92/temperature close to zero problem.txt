In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.

You need to solve this puzzle using as little characters as possible.
Sample temperatures
Here, -1 is the closest to 0.
  Rules
Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
  Game Input
Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.
Input

Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze

Line 2: The N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526
Output
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
Constraints
0 â‰¤ N < 10000
Example
Input

5
1 -2 -8 4 5

Output

1
