Build the Fibonacci Sequence but with given inputs instead of set inputs, 0 and 1. Construct an additive sequence with t, a number of times to loop, a, a first starting digit, and b, a second starting digit.
Input
An integer t for the number of times to loop
An integer a as the first starting digit
An integer b as the second starting digit
Output
Line 1: a as it is at the start of the current loop
Line 2: a as it is at the start of the current loop
...
Line t: a as it is at the start of the current loop
Constraints
0<t≤75
0≤a≤25
0≤b≤500
