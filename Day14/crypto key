You are working in a Government Security Department. Your task is to analyze all packets sent over a network. All information are encrypted using the Vigenere's encryption formula and a cipher is sent. You are given a key and have to decrypt the message. You have to find the decrypted message.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher

Each character is decoded independently of other characters
The white spaces are ignored.

N.B: The key has to be repeated to match the length of the string or message. If the key is longer than the message, only the part of the key matching the size of the message will be used.

Exemple 1:
Input: Message = tjtnm row
key = act
Output: thank you

cleartext = thank you
encrypted text: tjtnm row
key = act , with a=0 and c = 2, t=19
the message t =19, j=9, t=19, n=13, m=12, r=17, o=14, w=22
then the decryption will be:
t-a = 19-0=19
j-c=9-2=7
t-t=19-19=0
n-a=13-0=13
m-c=12-2=10
r-t=17-19=-2 here we have to do -2mod26 = 24
o-a=14-0=14
w-c=22-2=20

The clear text is the alphabets corresponding to the numbers, which will be:
19 = t, 7=h, 0=a, 13=n, 10=k, 24=y, 14=o, 20=u
which gives: thank you
Input
Line 1: A string or message to be decrypted.
Line 2: A word to be used as the key.
Output
Output the unencrypted string or message
Constraints
* The white spaces are ignored.
*The whole string or message is lowercase only
