The goal of your program is to compress a N by N grid into one single line using run-length encoding.
The grid contains only the characters "A", "B" or "C".
Input
Line 1: An integer N for the amount of rows and columns of the grid.
Next N lines: A string of N characters.
Output
Consecutive characters of the same type are expressed as the count followed by the character.
If the count is 1, it is omitted.
Consecutive means either:
- two characters next to each other on the same row
- or one character at the end of a given row and another one a the start of the next row

Line 1: The run-length encoding of the grid.
Constraints
3 ≤ N ≤ 7
Example
