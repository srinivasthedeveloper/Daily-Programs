A train is going along a track of a length of Lfeet, and is coasting at a starting speed of Sfeet/second. The train's speed decreases by half every second.


Example:
L = 10
S = 5
pos = position of train along track

0 seconds: s=5, pos=0
1 seconds: s=2.5, pos=5
2 seconds: s=1.75, pos=7.5
etc....
As the speed decreases, the position of the train along the track will get very close like 9.9999999999 feet but not 10, therefore the output for this example would be false.


More Examples:
S=40
L=100
output: false
---
S=60
L=100
output: true


There is a trick to it....

Output whether or not it will make it to the end of the track (true or false)
Input
Line 1: S Speed of Train (Feet/second)
Line 2: L Length of track (Feet)
Output
true if it will make it to the end of the track, false if it won't.
