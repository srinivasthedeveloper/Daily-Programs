You're a security consultant at a prestigious rubber duck museum. When you arrive at work one morning, everyone is in a panic. The most prized exhibit, Alan Turing's personal rubber duck, has been stolen overnight and replaced with a false replica!

After talking to everyone, you find out the following:
* One of the employees stole the rubber duck.
* The robbery must have happened between 20:00 (8pm) and 08:00 (8am)
* The thief forgot to close the case after stealing the duck.
* The electronic lock on the glass case holding the rubber duck creates a log entry every time the case is opened or closed.

You pull the logs from the case lock to figure out who has stolen the duck.

Write a program that finds and outputs the employee ID of the rubber duck thief!
Input
Line 1: n - The amount of log entries
The next n lines: Log entries on the form:
TIME EMPLOYEE_ID CASE_OPEN

Where:
TIME is a 24-hour clock timestamp on the form HH:MM
EMPLOYEE_ID is a 4-digit integer
CASE_OPEN is 1 if the case was opened and 0 if the case was closed
Output
The employee ID of the rubber duck thief as it appears in the logs.
Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10

For every log entry:
TIME is a 24-hour clock timestamp with the format HH:MM
EMPLOYEE_ID is a 4-digit integer
CASE_OPEN is always 1 or 0

CASE_OPEN is always 1 in the first log entry, and alternates between 1 and 0 for each log entry.

Log entries are always given in order, sorted by the timestamp.

The robbery always occurs between 20:00 and 08:00.

An innocent employee may close the case after the thief has stolen the rubber duck.
Example
Input

3
20:47 3474 1
20:49 3474 0
01:32 9651 1

Output

9651
