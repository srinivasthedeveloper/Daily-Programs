Let N be an integer.
It is said to be palindromic if it is the same reading backward or forward. For instance, 121 is palindromic in the usual base 10.
Note that a number could be palindromic in a base b and not in a base b'.

Given an integer N (in the usual decimal system) and a base b, you have to say if N is palindromic in base b.
Input
Line 1: An integer N in decimal system.
Line 2: A base b.
Output
Line 1: True if N is palindromic in base b, False otherwise.
Constraints

1 ≤ b ≤ 100
