All Digits - Pairs Count

The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the number of pairs X where the concatenation of the two integers in the pair consists of all the digits from 0 to 9 in any order at least once.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains X.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
38479 74180 967132 1584604 726510 6512160

Output:
3

Explanation:
The 3 possible pairs are given below.
(38479, 726510) -> 38479726510
(38479, 6512160) -> 384796512160
(967132, 1584604) -> 9671321584604
The concatenation of the two integers in each pair contains all the digits from 0 to 9 at least once.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
2670589 243106 3145987 5789

Output:
4
