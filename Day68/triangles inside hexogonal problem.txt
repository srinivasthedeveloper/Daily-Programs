Parse the regular hexagon, and tell how much regular unit triangle do you find, if the length of one side of the regular hexagon is n unit(s).

As it is well known, every regular hexagon, that has a positive integer value for the length of one side can be split into a positive integer value of regular triangles, where the regular triangle has sides with 1 unit of length.

For example, if the hexagon has sides with 1 unit of length, it will be split into 6 triangles.
If the hexagon has sides with 2 units of length, it will be split into 24 triangles.
Input
Line 1: The length of one side of the hexagon is n unit
