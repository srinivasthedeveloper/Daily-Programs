Mario is marching to the castle to save the princess. In the last phase he has to jump over a number of pillars of different heights. When Mario jumps from a lower pillar to a higher pillar he has to use High Jump. When he jumps to a pillar of lower or same height he has to use Low Jump.
Your task is to find out how many High Jumps and Low Jumps Mario has to do.
Input
Line 1: An integer N representing the number of pillars. Mario is now standing on the first pillar.
Line 2: A sequence of N integers separated by space representing the height H of each pillar Mario has to overcome.
Output
Number of High Jumps and Low Jumps separated by a space.
Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 25
0 ≤ H ≤ 12
