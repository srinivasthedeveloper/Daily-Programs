Colors are usually represented in code using 6 digit hex color codes. These consist of a hash, followed by 3 numbers in hexadecimal notation from 0-255. The first number represents red, the second green, and the third blue. For example, purple could be represented with #FF00FF.

You must convert red, green, and blue values to a single hex color code.
