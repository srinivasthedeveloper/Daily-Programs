The Paperclip Maximizer
Statement
You are shopping at your local online paperclip store.

You want to buy as many paperclips as possible, and you have at most C units of cryptocurrency to spend. The store has N different physical boxes of paperclips available for purchase. Each of the boxes is made by a different supplier, so the price and the number of paperclips may vary from box to box.

For each physical box of paperclips, you can either choose to buy that box (if you can afford it) or choose not to buy it. You cannot buy the same physical box of paperclips more than once.

You must output the maximum total number of paperclips you can buy, without exceeding your spending limit.
Input
Line 1: Two space separated integers C and N for your spending limit and the number of boxes.
Next N lines: Two space separated integers price and paperclips for the price of one of the boxes and the number of paperclips in that box.
Output
Line 1: The maximum total number of paperclips you can buy, while spending at most C units of cryptocurrency. If you cannot afford any of the boxes, output 0.
Constraints
0 ≤ C < 1000
0 ≤ N < 10
0 ≤ price,paperclips < 1000
