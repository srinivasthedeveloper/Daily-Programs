X Odd Integers - Subarrays

The program must accept N integers and an integer X as the input. The program must print the count of subarrays having exactly X odd integers as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N and X separated by a space.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the count of subarrays having exactly X odd integers.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 2
3 4 3 1

Output:
3

Explanation:
All possible subarrays are {3}, {4}, {3}, {1}, {3, 4}, {4, 3}, {3, 1}, {3, 4, 3}, {4, 3, 1} and {3, 4, 3, 1}.
There are 3 subarrays having exactly 2 odd integers {3, 4, 3}, {4, 3, 1} and {3, 1}.
So 3 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 3
1 2 2 3 4

Output:
0
